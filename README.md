# LAB 05b

## Finishing the About Me Project

I build a website that allows the interaction with the users by asking them some questions about me in a funny way as a guessing game using JavaScript language and show the users if the answer is correct or not.
On the other hand, make the users feel happy by greeting them using their name in the greetings message.
Also, I give the users many attempts if they answered wrong so they can answer the question again, at the end I showed them their final score to make them feel fun. and then I made some styling using CSS.

### Reflections and Comments

- Adding a new CSS features.

- I think that I am doing very well and I am acquiring a very good knowledge more than I thought, so I can evaluate my    learning as a very good and in the progress to be excellent since I can test my knowledge during the lab and I started   learning how to fix problems that may faced me while doing the assignments.  

- Taking notes during the lecture is my favorite way to record every single detail which would be very useful for me, so I can go back to my notes at every time I want when I forget or stuck on something.
Actually I am evaluating everything that I've learned continuously to make sure that I am good and I don't have any issues.

- As for someone like me with civil engineering background and zero knowledge about programming, I feel so proud that I am doing a great effort to learn more and more about programming and I can make sure of that when I see my grades and my TA's comments on my work.

- I've learned using very important languages in software development such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown. Also I've learned how to use many different tools to write codes and creating repositories like: GitHub, Replit, Git, and Visual Studio. I also practiced the A-C-P which is very beneficial method to clone the codes from cloud/online to my local machine and how to make changes on the codes in my local machine and then pushing up my workÂ  online(GitHub) to share my work with others.

- At this lab I practiced a very useful stuff and learning how to allow the interaction with the browser using JS codes and statements such as : if, switch, and I learned how to ask the user for something using promot and how to display a response for the user using alerts.
- I've used (break) to break out the loop and I practiced the usage of nested loops, it was pretty hard but it is okay I did it at the end, and I was very useful thing to learn.
- I practiced the usage of logical operators which are very important for JS codes.
